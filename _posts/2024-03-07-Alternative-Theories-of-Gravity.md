## Alternative Theories of Gravity

While Î›CDM cosmology has successfully described our Universe, the elusive physical origin and characteristics of dark matter, a fundamental component, remain poorly understood despite its ubiquitous presence. This enigma prompts a reevaluation of dark matter through modifications to the underlying theory of gravity. One such endeavor involves the introduction of entropic gravity and its application to cosmological theory. In our research, we aim to investigate the validity of emergent gravity on the galactic scale. This scale is particularly pertinent for studying modified gravity as it allows us to focus solely on gravitational interactions, with minimal influence from complex baryonic physics. Beginning with an exploration of galactic dynamics under emergent gravity, we aspire to extend the scope of this new theory to encompass much larger scales.
