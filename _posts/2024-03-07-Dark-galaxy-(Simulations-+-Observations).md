Dark galaxies, with little or no stars, are predicted by the hierarchical galaxy formation model within Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology. Detecting and confirming them by observation is challenging due to their faintness. Our research delves into the origin, evolution, and various properties of dark galaxies through simulations. Additionally, we aim to identify them in HI surveys, particularly those without optical counterparts, thereby connecting simulation with observation.
