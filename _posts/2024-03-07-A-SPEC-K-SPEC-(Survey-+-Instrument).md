## A-SPEC/K-SPEC (Survey + Instrument)
<img src="/images/kspec.png" width="100%" height="100%">

The K-SPEC project aims to develop a multi-object spectrograph (MOS) system for the all-sky spectroscopic survey, A-SPEC. As part of K-SPEC, we plan to install the MOS system at the KMTNet telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia, containing 169 fibers in a 6-square-degree field of view. The primary targets of the survey will be nearby(Ks<13.75) galaxies, which will provide a comprehensive view of our local universe.
