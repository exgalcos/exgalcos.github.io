## Galaxy Rotation Curves

<img src="/images/rc.png" width="100%" height="100%">

Recent studies have found the diverse rotation curves of galaxies using observational data. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to reproduce the observational results and to figure out the cause of the diverse rotation curves. We successfully reproduce the observational results of Yoon et al. 2021, showing the relation between the shape of rotation curves and galaxy properties. The outer slope of the rotation curves decreases as galaxies are more massive, and increases as galaxies are more disky. There is a hint that the dark matter fraction plays an important role in determining the outer slope of the rotation curves.
