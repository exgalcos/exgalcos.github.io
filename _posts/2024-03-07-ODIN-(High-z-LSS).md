ODIN (High-z LSS).
One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrow-bands (ODIN) survey is an ongoing project to identify Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) at redshifts 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 using three custom narrow-band filters. We will also identify protoclusters, Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs), and Lyman alpha blobs (LABs), and study their physical properties and their relation to large-scale structures. The observations are almost complete (as of March 2024), and the first science paper on the relationship between LABs and the cosmic web has recently been published (see the Figure below; Ramakrishnan et al. 2023). For an overview of the ODIN survey, please see Lee et al. 2024 and Firestone et al. 2023.
