The ΛCDM model predicts that our universe consists of a large fraction of unknown dark matter and dark energy, and simulations are invaluable tools for testing these unseen components. 

Our team is involved in a wide range of research on simulations from their development to their execution and analysis. We currently developing a novel hydrodynamical code for cosmological simulations and running the largest ΛCDM N-body simulations(Horizon Run Dark Energy; HRDE). We also running simulations with different dark energy equation of state(w) to test the properties of dark energy with the CPL[1] model (Multiverse).
